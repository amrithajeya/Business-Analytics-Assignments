# BUSA3021 Business Analytics Project

## Unit Description 

> This unit provides a platform for students to exercise the knowledge and skills that they have gained in previous units. The major component of the unit is an organisation-based group project, where students will actively engage with an organisation including but not limited to: not-for-profit organisations, government agencies, companies, and industry partners. Group work engages students in the challenges of interpersonal communication, task allocation, coordination and control. Students will gain an insight into the analytical problems faced by organisations and be able to contextualise their graduate capabilities into the final business project. The unit will consider key issues, concepts and frameworks of analytics ethics, and social responsibility, and how these can be applied to policy and practice. The class is conducted through lectures, workshops and discussions where students will develop an analytical solution around the client specified information-based problem. Throughout the unit, the emphasis is on the analysis process: identifying information needs, acquiring the necessary information, interpreting it and using it as the basis for strategic recommendations back to the client partner.
