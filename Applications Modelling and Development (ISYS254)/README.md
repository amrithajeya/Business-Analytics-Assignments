**Unit Description**
This unit is an intermediate unit to deliver a solid foundation in concepts, methods, tools and
techniques that organisations use to control the information they use in their day-to-day
business, with a particular focus on how computer-based technologies can most effectively
contribute to the way business is structured. The units focuses on the fundamental concepts
and models of applications development so that they can understand the key processes

testing a solution in a programming language.
